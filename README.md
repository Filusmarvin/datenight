Dinner and a Date helps you find some one and gives you Ideas of places close to you that you can go out to dinner or a date or just meet for some coffee. It helps takes the stress out of finding out where to go after meeting that person and gives you some great conversational points. It takes combined interests so you guys can do something fun and enjoyable with each other.

 Have you ever been in a rut where you find a person but do not know where to take them? For all the lonely people like me who is the not only the creator but client as well, finding out where to take some one is difficult! Do you people not know what females are? They are nothing but complex human beings. To make it simple, I wanted to make that an easy and simple task using a facebook based user name and password sign in, a firebase messaging system that allows you to message back and forth. A facebook Api that displays a portion of the persons profile information so you wont be a victom of Cat-Fish.




  It helps you take the stress out after finding a person it sets you up with dating ideas. Well it will have a personality test that will help groom the best conversational points and what you guys have in common and give you ideas of where to take them based on where that person likes to go.  It will have user Authentication with a Facebook Api so you can see just a portion of that persons account so you know that person  is not cat fishing you. It will definitely be react based and actually probably have like 3 Api integrated into it. Hopefully when i continue and make this app big enough and useable to the whole world it will be with redux.
